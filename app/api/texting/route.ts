It typically comes from sources such as bootstrapping (personal savings), angel investors, venture capitalists, or crowdfunding. Startups go through different funding stages—seed, Series A, B, and beyond—each helping them scale operations, develop products, and reach more customers.\n\nInput: Give a brief description of the stock market.\nOutput: The stock market is a marketplace where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It operates through stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. The stock market plays a crucial role in the economy, allowing businesses to raise capital and investors to grow their wealth.\n\nInput: Explain the benefits of meditation.\nOutput: Meditation is a practice that helps calm the mind and improve focus. It reduces stress, enhances emotional well-being, and promotes better sleep. Regular meditation has also been linked to improved concentration, increased self-awareness, and better overall mental health.\n\nInput: Describe a cat.\nOutput: A cat is a small, domesticated carnivorous mammal known for its agility, sharp claws, and playful nature. Cats have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in low-light conditions. They communicate through purring, meowing, and body language. As pets, they are independent yet affectionate, often forming strong bonds with their owners.\n\n\n\nInput: Describe a rose flower.\nOutput: A rose is a fragrant and beautiful flower known for its soft petals and thorny stems. Roses come in various colors, each symbolizing different emotions—red for love, yellow for friendship, and white for purity. They are widely used in gardens, perfumes, and as gifts for special occasions.\n\n\n\nInput: Describe the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.\nOutput: SQL databases are relational, using structured tables and ACID transactions for consistency, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility with document, key-value, and graph storage. SQL is used for structured data (e.g., PostgreSQL), whereas NoSQL is preferred for scalability (e.g., MongoDB).\n
